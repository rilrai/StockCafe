# StockCafe
OOP project

The idea - in some Cafe we have a strange system of prices:
Every time smthing is ordered, price on all other menu positions gets lower and price on THIS menu positions gets higher.
(Sometimes tea costs 50$ and chicken costs 1$)
When a menu position is ordered it's price gets back to basic (normal menu price).
Data is set in MySQL database.

The task is to write a programm that will do it =)
I used 5 minutes delay in reading data.

P.S. There was no need in multithreading, but, as far as it's a practice project, why the hell not? =))
